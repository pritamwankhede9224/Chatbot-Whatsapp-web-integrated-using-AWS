What we are building is a basic Chatbot that we can use for Translating, knowing more about its creator, and directing to LinkedIn to contact in person.


Workflow -> train a file for phrases -> use amazon lex to create a bot -> use training file to get slot type for using translate -> invoking a function which has AWS translate access which translates user’s source language into target language -> also creating multiple functionalities for user to interact.


Services used : 

* AMAZON LEX
* LAMBDA
* PYTHON(FOR TRAINING i.e. NLTK)
